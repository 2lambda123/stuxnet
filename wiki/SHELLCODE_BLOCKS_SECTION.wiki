The *SHELLCODE_BLOCKS_SECTION* is _0xB3A_ (2874) bytes long and is formed by four distinct blocks:
 # The *MAP_INFO_BLOCK* (_36 bytes_) where the information about _the mapped section_ will be stored.
 # The *CODE_BLOCK1* (_1189 bytes_) which contains pure _ASM code_.
 # The *CODE_BLOCK2* (_41 bytes_) which contains pure _ASM code_.
 # The *CODE_BLOCK3* (_1608 bytes_) which contains pure _C code_.

=== MAP_INFO_BLOCK ===
The *MAP_INFO_BLOCK* is _36_ bytes long and is formed by 9 UINT32:

|| Position || Value || Known value ||
|| 0 || (UINT32)&pCurrentProcessMapView[4] + GetRealtivePositionOfFunc1() || pCurrentProcessMapView + 1639 ||
|| 1 || (UINT32)&pCurrentProcessMapView[4] + GetRealtivePositionOfFunc3() || pCurrentProcessMapView + 1949 ||
|| 2 || pModuleProcessBaseAddr + iPointer || pCurrentProcessMapView + 36 ||
|| 3 || (UINT32)&DecodeModuleNameA - (UINT32)&__ASM_BLOCK1_0 || 1189 ||

|| 5 || (UINT32)&__ASM_BLOCK1_0 - (UINT32)&__ASM_BLOCK0_0 || 41 ||
|| 6 || pModuleProcessBaseAddr + iPointer || pCurrentProcessMapView + 1266 ||
|| 7 || iShellcodeSize || 1608 ||
|| 8 || a2 || Pointer to the section which contains the main DLL ||

=== CODE_BLOCK1 ===
The *CODE_BLOCK1* contains the pure ASM code from __ASM_BLOCK1_0 to DecodeModuleNameA (excluded).

=== CODE_BLOCK2 ===
The *CODE_BLOCK2* contains the pure ASM code __ASM_BLOCK0_0.

=== CODE_BLOCK3 ===
The *CODE_BLOCK3* contains the pure ASM code from NTDLL_CODE_SHELLCODE_INIT to NTDLL_CODE_SHELLCODE_END.
